   Ship Destroying
   + ----------- +
A game about destroying enemy fleets and leaving traumatised wifes, husbands and children grieve
for the people you killed.

The game consists of the following phases:

(1) Setting the boards width (default is 10).
(2) Registering the players (at least 2). Each player must have multiple ships, each of whom is a
    row or a column and between 3 and 6 (both ends inclusive) fields long. Each player must plaster
    10-25% of the entire field with its boats. It ships of one player may not overlap with each
    each other, but with ships of other players.
(3) A starting player is randomly determined.
(4) The players take turns one after an other, until only one player is left. This player is the
    winner. Players get "destroyed" by having all their shots destroyed.
(5) In each turn, the player can shoot at random positions until they miss. As there may be more
    than one player and each shot is fired against all players but the one who shot it, a player
    may hit more than one ship with each shot. You will be told the number of ships and the names
    of the players you hit with each shot, and you can view a map showing where you hit and where
    you missed. You can also view a map showing where you where hit and where your ships are
    positioned. Players will be told if they destroy a ship.

The game may be started by running main.py or by running main_cmd.py, the later of whom imports
the former and runs it with a command line interface instead of the default heavily guided one.
As ship destroying is a game build open the underlying theme of trust in the original paper
version (one can always just lie), the cmd-version is trust-based as well. As the order in which
actions are performed is more free than in the guided version, one can switch more often and one
manually decides when to flush the screen for privacy reasons and when not to and so on.

If you are running said command-line version, use the command ?c to view a list of all commands.
